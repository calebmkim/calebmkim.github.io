I am a PhD Student at MIT (starting in Fall '24) working with [Saman Amarasinghe][saman].
I am broadly interested in programming languages, compilers, and computer architecture.

I graduated from Cornell in December '23, where I worked with [Adrian Sampson][adrian] and [Rachit Nigam][rachit] on [Calyx][calyx], an intermediate language for compilers that target hardware accelerators.
