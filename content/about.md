I just graduated (December '23) from Cornell with a BA in Computer Science, and I am applying to PhD programs this cycle.
I am broadly interested in programming languages, compilers, and computer architecture.
Currently, I work with [Adrian Sampson][adrian] and [Rachit Nigam][rachit] on [Calyx][calyx], an intermediate language for compilers that target hardware accelerators.
