I watch a lot of sports videos on YouTube, and I came across a couple interesting ones: [comparing NFL quarterbacks to thanksgiving foods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4UWDXjnoDM) and [comparing NFL quarterbacks to actors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLvBnxTwOE4). It's pretty absurd concept, but after he explains the comparisons they kind of make sense. 

In this blog post, I'll be comparing NBA players to programming languages. Please don't take this too seriously. 
#### Kevin Durant: Python

Fans and media often call Kevin Durant the most "malleable" or "plug and play" superstar in the NBA. With most NBA superstars, their team has to change the way they play to revolve around that player. For example, whenever I watch Luka Dončić or Lebron James play, the offense needs to revolve around them: they always have have the ball in their hands, they always bring the ball up the court, etc. Likewise, James Harden requires a million dribbles every offensive possession. Giannis Antetekounpo's inability to shoot from outside required the Bucks to build a team of shooters around him (including making 7'1'' Brook Lopez shoot a ton of 3's). Steph Curry requires you to shift your defensive assignments to hide him on defense: that's why Klay Thompson always guarded the other team's best guard. Kevin Durant, on the other hand, doesn't require this: he doesn't need the ball in his hands the entire time, he doesn't need a million dribbles to get in his rhythm, his perimeter shooting allows you to have good spacing on offense, and he's a versatile defender. 

It was a bit difficult for me to find stats to back it up, but here are some: 

Kevin Durant is the most plug-and-play superstar in the NBA. So why is he similar to Python? Because Python is one of the the most "plug-and-play"  programming language. In other words, you can quickly learn and pick up Python compared to other language, which is due largely to its natural and intuitive syntax and semantics. For example, my college uses Python as the language for its intro CS class for people with no programming experience. And once you know Python, it is very easy to quickly hack up a small script to do a specific task. For example, it has a million libraries for a variety of your needs. Also, from my experience, it's dynamic typing make it a lot easier to quickly hack up a script, compared to a statically typed language like Java. 

However, there are some downsides to Python: while it is great for a script you need to cobble together quickly, it's generally not seen as good of a choice for large-scale projects. In particular, its dynamically typing and slow performance make it less than ideal.

Plus, there's a meme about Durant being a [snake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfgHeIpMfMc) when he left the Thunder to join the Warriors in 2016.
